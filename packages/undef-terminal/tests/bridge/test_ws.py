"""WebSocket integration tests for the terminal hijack hub routes.

Uses FastAPI's synchronous TestClient with nested websocket_connect() calls so that
worker and browser connections can be open concurrently.  Each TestClient WebSocket
runs in its own thread backed by the same ASGI event-loop, so message ordering is
deterministic via internal queues.

Initial messages sent by the hub on connection
----------------------------------------------
Browser (/ws/browser/{id}/term):
  1. {"type": "hello", ...}
  2. {"type": "hijack_state", ...}
  3. last_snapshot if one exists (otherwise _request_snapshot is called, no browser msg)

Worker (/ws/worker/{id}/term):
  1. {"type": "snapshot_req", ...}   (hub requests a snapshot immediately)
