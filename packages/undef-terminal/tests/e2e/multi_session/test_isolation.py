"""E2E: Two concurrent sessions with isolated EventBus subscribers.

Scenarios
---------
1. Sessions s1 and s2 each have their own WS worker sending snapshots.
   EventBus subscribers for each session receive only their session's events —
   no cross-contamination.
2. Two long-poll callers blocking on s1 and s2 simultaneously both unblock
   with exactly the right event when their respective worker fires.
