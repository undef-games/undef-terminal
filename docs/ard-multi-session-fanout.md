# ARD: Multi-Session Fan-Out (Broadcast Input)

## Problem

Coordinated operations across a fleet of servers — rolling deployments, parallel configuration changes, synchronized maintenance windows — require the same commands to be executed on N terminal sessions simultaneously. Current tooling (cssh, tmux broadcast, Ansible) operates at the SSH/host layer with no visibility into the proxy, no role-based access control, and no per-session response aggregation.

undef-terminal controls the input path for every managed session. A fan-out primitive at the hub layer can broadcast a single input stream to N sessions with full RBAC, audit trail, per-session output capture, and live divergence detection — without any host-side agent or SSH multiplexer.

---

## Goals

- Send a single input event to a named set of target sessions simultaneously.
- Capture per-session output for a configurable window after each fanned-out input.
- Detect and surface divergence: sessions whose output differs significantly from the majority.
- Support dynamic fan-out groups (ad-hoc sets) and persistent named groups.
- Gate fan-out on admin role and require explicit opt-in from session owners (or admin override).
- Emit a structured `FanOutEvent` to the audit trail for each command sent and each response captured.
- Impose no additional latency on non-fan-out sessions.

---

## Non-Goals

- Replacing Ansible, Terraform, or configuration management tools. Fan-out is for *interactive* parallel terminal control, not automated orchestration.
- Coordinating across multiple undef-terminal deployments (single-hub scope only for v1).
- Modifying output on a per-session basis before delivery to the controlling browser.

## Architecture

### Group Model

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class FanOutGroup:
    group_id: str
    name: str
    worker_ids: list[str]          # target sessions
    created_by: str                # principal subject_id
    created_at: float
    mode: str                      # "parallel" | "sequential"
    stop_on_first_error: bool      # sequential only: halt if a session returns non-zero exit code
    response_window_ms: int        # how long to collect output after each send (default 2000)
    divergence_threshold: float    # Levenshtein ratio below which outputs are flagged as divergent (0.0–1.0)
```

Groups are ephemeral by default (in-memory, discarded on hub restart). A `SqliteFanOutStore` provides persistence.

### Fan-Out Controller

```python
class FanOutController:
    def __init__(self, hub: TermHub, store: FanOutStore | None = None) -> None: ...

    async def create_group(self, group: FanOutGroup) -> str: ...          # returns group_id
    async def delete_group(self, group_id: str) -> None: ...
    async def get_group(self, group_id: str) -> FanOutGroup | None: ...
    async def list_groups(self, principal: str) -> list[FanOutGroup]: ...

    async def send(
        self,
        group_id: str,
        data: str,
        *,
        principal: str,
        response_window_ms: int | None = None,
    ) -> FanOutResult: ...
```

`send()` fans the input to all target sessions via `hub.send_worker(worker_id, ...)` in parallel (using `asyncio.gather`). It then collects snapshot deltas from each session for `response_window_ms` milliseconds, assembles a `FanOutResult`, and emits audit events.

### Result Schema

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class SessionFanOutResult:
    worker_id: str
    ok: bool                    # False if worker not connected
    output_delta: str | None    # output captured after the send
    divergent: bool             # True if output differs significantly from majority

@dataclass(slots=True)
class FanOutResult:
    group_id: str
    send_id: str                # uuid4 per send operation
    command: str
    sent_at: float
    results: list[SessionFanOutResult]
    divergent_sessions: list[str]    # worker_ids flagged as divergent
    failed_sessions: list[str]       # worker_ids where ok=False
```

### Output Delta Collection

After sending input, the controller subscribes each target session to a temporary `OutputCollector` that captures snapshot diffs for `response_window_ms`. A snapshot diff is the set of lines added since the last snapshot. The collector is removed after the window closes.

Divergence is detected by computing pairwise Levenshtein similarity between all session output deltas and comparing against `group.divergence_threshold`. Sessions below the threshold are added to `divergent_sessions`.

### REST API

```
POST /api/fanout/groups
    Body: FanOutGroupCreate
    → FanOutGroup

GET /api/fanout/groups
    → list[FanOutGroup]

DELETE /api/fanout/groups/{group_id}
    → 204 No Content

POST /api/fanout/groups/{group_id}/send
    Body: {"data": "kubectl rollout status ...", "response_window_ms": 3000}
    → FanOutResult

GET /api/fanout/groups/{group_id}/history?limit=20
    → list[FanOutResult]
```

All endpoints require admin role. `created_by` is set from the resolved `Principal`.

### Browser WS Protocol

A controlling admin browser can initiate fan-out via WS (in addition to REST):

```json
// Browser → hub
{"type": "fanout_send", "group_id": "fleet-prod", "data": "uptime\n"}

// Hub → controlling browser (streamed as results arrive)
{"type": "fanout_result", "send_id": "...", "results": [...], "divergent_sessions": [...]}

// Hub → all browsers watching a target session (so observers know input came from fan-out)
{"type": "fanout_input", "group_id": "fleet-prod", "send_id": "...", "command": "uptime\n", "from_principal": "alice"}
```

### Sequential Mode

When `mode="sequential"`, the controller iterates sessions in `group.worker_ids` order, awaiting the response window before proceeding to the next. If `stop_on_first_error=True`, it halts when the output delta from a session does not match the expected success pattern (configurable regex, defaults to absence of known error strings).

### TermHub Integration

`TermHub` gains an optional `fan_out_controller` attribute set after construction (same pattern as `on_worker_empty`):

```python
hub = TermHub(...)
controller = FanOutController(hub=hub, store=SqliteFanOutStore("/var/lib/uterm/fanout.db"))
hub.fan_out_controller = controller
```

No changes to `TermHub.__init__` signature. The REST and WS routes check `hub.fan_out_controller is not None` before handling fan-out frames.

---

## CF Backend Parity

Fan-out in the CF backend operates at the KV + DO level: the Default worker fans the send request to each session's DO instance via HTTP fetch. Per-session DO instances receive the input via their existing `push_worker_input` path. Response aggregation is collected by polling `GET /hijack/{id}/snapshot` for each DO.

The `RuntimeProtocol` does not gain new methods for v1 CF fan-out — it is orchestrated at the Default worker layer.

---

## MCP Integration

Two new MCP tools:

- `fanout_group_create` — create a named group of sessions
- `fanout_send` — send input to a group, return aggregated results

This enables AI agents (Claude via MCP) to coordinate fleet-wide terminal operations with full result aggregation — a capability not available in any current MCP terminal tool.

---

## Security Considerations

- Fan-out requires admin role. There is no operator-level fan-out.
- `created_by` is recorded on every group and every send operation and is non-spoofable (set from `Principal`, not from request body).
- Sessions in a group that do not have a connected worker are reported as `failed` but do not block the fan-out to other sessions.
- The `fanout_input` broadcast to observer browsers includes `from_principal` so operators watching a session can see that input came from a fan-out operation, not from a local hijack.
- Groups may not contain sessions to which the creating principal does not have `can_read_session` access. This is enforced at group creation time by checking `authz.can_read_session(principal, session_def)` for each `worker_id`.
- Maximum group size is configurable (default 50 sessions) to prevent inadvertent fleet-wide destructive commands.

---

## Testing

- `test_fanout_parallel_send.py` — fan-out to 5 sessions, all workers connected, all receive input, results aggregated correctly.
- `test_fanout_partial_failure.py` — 2 of 5 workers not connected; `failed_sessions` populated, others succeed.
- `test_fanout_sequential_stop_on_error.py` — sequential mode halts after first session output matches error pattern.
- `test_fanout_divergence_detection.py` — sessions with differing output are flagged as divergent.
- `test_fanout_authz.py` — operator cannot create groups; groups may not include sessions the principal cannot read.
- `test_fanout_mcp.py` — `fanout_send` MCP tool returns structured results consumable by an AI agent.

## Open Questions

1. Should fan-out groups be scoped to a principal (only creator can use) or shared (any admin can use)?
2. Should there be a "dry run" mode that shows which sessions would receive the input without sending it?
3. Should divergence detection use Levenshtein distance, semantic embedding similarity, or a configurable comparator?
4. What is the right response window default (2000 ms)? Should it adapt based on session type (Telnet vs SSH vs WS)?
5. Should sequential mode support a configurable inter-session delay to avoid thundering herd on shared infrastructure?
6. Should the MCP `fanout_send` tool stream partial results as sessions respond, or batch the full result?
